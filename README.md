## üê≥ Docker Setup

HeatLink can be deployed quickly using Docker. Here's how you can get started:

### üìù Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  heatlink:
    image: paulchartres/heatlink
    container_name: heatlink
    environment:
      - USERNAME=your.email@example.com
      - PASSWORD=supersecretpassword
      - LATITUDE=37.2343 # Optional, but required if you want to use the weather and external temperature/humidity feature
      - LONGITUDE=-115.8066 # Optional, but required if you want to use the weather and external temperature/humidity feature
      - ARCHIVAL_CRON=0 * * * * # Optional, defaults to every minute
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data # Map the container's data directory to your host (for the SQLite database)
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # Map the container's port 3000 to your host
    restart: always
```

Run the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can also find an example `docker-compose.example.yml` file in the repository.

### üõ†Ô∏è Running with `docker run`

If you prefer running the container directly, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name heatlink \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/data \
  -e USERNAME=your.email@example.com \
  -e PASSWORD=supersecretpassword \
  -e LATITUDE=37.2343 \
  -e LONGITUDE=-115.8066 \
  -e ARCHIVAL_CRON="0 * * * *" \

```bash
docker logs -f heatlink
```
